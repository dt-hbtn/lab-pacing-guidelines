#### Monday
- Projects opening today:
    - `C - Strace` (4 required tasks)
    - `Multithreading` (7 required tasks in intranet, but see note below)
        - `Task 2` and `Task 3` will not count against you if you don't do them (they are particularly time consuming and most of that time is spent on on Gaussian blur instead of multithreading)
        - So the number of tasks that are truly required is 5
- `C - Strace`
    - Review the `Concepts` and `Resources` pages (x86_64 assembly page is just provided for review of 64-bit registers)
    - Complete the quiz
    - Copy the helper header file from this repository https://github.com/hs-hq/0x0B-strace.c into your `strace` project directory
    - Look ahead at all 4 tasks to make a reusable design for your code
    - Complete `Task 0`

#### Tuesday
- `C - Strace`
    - Complete `Task 1`

#### Wednesday
- `C - Strace`
    - Complete `Task 2`

#### Thursday
- Optional PLD, 9-3
- `C - Strace`
    - Complete `Task 3`
- `Multithreading`
    - Review the `Concepts` and `Resources` pages
    - Look ahead at the required tasks (remember `Task 2` and `Task 3` will not count against your grade but feel free to complete them)

#### Friday
- `Multithreading`
    - Complete `Task 0`
    - Complete `Task 1`
