# DS1400: Search Algorithms (Fall 2024)
## Course Overview
__From the catalog...__
"In this course, students will apply their knowledge of algorithms into search problems to solve problems or questions with the goal of providing a satisfactory solution."

__What it means...__
In this course, you will practice building regexes for string pattern matching (i.e., fuzzy search) and (in C) you will implement interpolation search and exponential search.

## Project Overview
- `Regular expression`
    - Opens _Monday, August 26_
    - Due _Wednesday, September 4 @ 11:59PM_ (open 10 calendar days)
- `Search Algorithms Advanced`
    - Opens _Monday, August 26_
    - Due _Wednesday, September 4 @ 11:59PM_ (open 10 calendar days)

Note: `Regular expression` and `Search Algorithms Advanced` are assigned concurrently!

## Peer Learning Days (PLDs)

This course has 2 PLDs
- Thursday, August 29

## Project Pacing Guide

---

### Week 1 (August 26 - August 30)

- Complete `Regular expression` by the first PLD on August 29.
- Then on that same PLD we can cover any issues with the search algorithms

### Week 2 (September 2 - September 6)
- Complete `Search Algorithms Advanced` by the second PLD on September 5
